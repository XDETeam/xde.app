	/// Logs usually are considered as renderers that flatten structured data into text files.
	/// This might be stupid from both writing log perspective and further logs analysis.
	/// Probably they should by structured, aspected (log partition that contains errors only
	/// for example). And then log becomes a structured storage which is "append-only"?
