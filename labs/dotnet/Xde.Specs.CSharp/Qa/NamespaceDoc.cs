	/// - This can become a "Specs" namespace?
	/// - For specs there is one interesting requirement. Let's say we have some subsystem
	/// that have a bunch of tests/specs. And we want to compare several implementations of
	/// this subsystem. How to ensure that all tests were implemented. Abstract class with
	/// a lot of test methods is not a good option.
